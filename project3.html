    <h1>Project 3</h1>

    <p>
        Project 3 is focused on creating something more functional and meaningful. 
        For this project, I am working on a small interactive feature or tool that users can try out. 
        It could be a contact form, a mini app, a simple calculator, a gallery, or any feature 
        that allows users to interact with the page.
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to learn how interactivity works on the web. 
        I am beginning to explore how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can work together to create 
        useful and engaging experiences. This project helps me understand how to build features 
        that respond to user actions.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I improve this project, I may add more advanced features, animations, or visual effects. 
        This is another step toward building more complete and functional websites in the future.

    <h1>Project 1</h1>

    <p>
        This is my first project, and it focuses on creating my own personal website. 
        The goal of this project is to design a simple, clean, and easy-to-navigate webpage 
        that introduces who I am, what I enjoy doing, and the work I am proud of.
    </p>

    <p>
        On this website, visitors will be able to learn more about my hobbies, skills, 
        background, and future goals. I want the site to reflect my personality while still 
        being professional and user-friendly. As I continue improving it, I plan to add more 
        pages, better styling, and interactive features.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project also helps me practice important web development skills such as 
        writing HTML, styling with CSS, and organizing information clearly. 
        It is the first step in building my online presence and showcasing what I can create.

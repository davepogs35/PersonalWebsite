    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        My name is <strong>Dave Matthew B. Olaso</strong>, and I am a BSIT student. 
        I enjoy creating websites and exploring new things in the world of technology. 
        I like learning how different tools, codes, and designs work together to build 
        useful and creative projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am always trying to improve my skills and gain more experience. 
        Every project I make helps me understand web development better and inspires me 
        to keep learning.

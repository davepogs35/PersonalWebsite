    <h1>Project 2</h1>

    <p>
        Project 2 focuses on improving my web development skills by creating a more advanced webpage. 
        In this project, I am experimenting with new design elements such as animations, better layouts, 
        and improved navigation. The goal is to push my creativity further and make a webpage that 
        looks more modern and interactive.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project also helps me practice organizing content in a cleaner way. I am learning how to 
        use sections, cards, responsive design, and more polished CSS styles. Every change I make teaches me 
        something new about how websites are built and how to make them more user-friendly.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I continue updating this project, I plan to add more interactive features, such as hover effects, 
        animations, and maybe even JavaScript functions. This helps me grow from simple webpage creation 
        to more dynamic and creative web design.
